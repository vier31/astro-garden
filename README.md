# Welcome to [my digital garden](https://banauso.net)

After years of procrastinating on a blog, because making digital things real poses a challenge for me, I came across the idea of a digital garden.

This is a very neat idea, because it frees me from this constant pressure I am feeling when 'writing a blog,' where I need to fill aconstant stream, that turns stale as soon as I am distracted or occupied with other things. While of course this is a head thing and no one really cares and there are plenty of blogs out there, yada yada yada.. For me, it made things impossible. Too high the expectations. Since there are people out there that have been writing for ages, and can now look back on many pages filled. So. A garden it is. A digital space to collect things I make.
