# Mission Statement

What is the point of all this? I need to ask this myself, because it is so easy for me to get lost in all the possibilities. In fact, this getting-lost-thing is a fundamental part of my biography. So much so, that I am constantly side-tracking, but I am at the same time not turning this into a public therapy session.


`“Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)”
― Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass `

I discovered this quote back in school and only now, some twenty years later, I am grasping its meaning. Very well then. This place is also my continuation of a school project, that was very dear to my heart and at the same time an experience in getting your work thrashed by someone else. What happened back then was that we had to keep a working journal in my philosophy class, like keep track of things we read and thought and such. It was fun, I liked it and started to tend to it as best as I could then. Only to have my teacher one day hand it back to me with red ink written notes and criticism all over the place. I didn't write anymore. It completely halted my effort in working on this notebook.

Twenty years it took me, to get back to mustering up the confidence to carve out a space for me to write, create and tinker without worry about what others might have to say. Which is why there won't be any comments enabled around here. Thanks. (Though there are ways to contact me and talk to me)

## Interests and topics

There are a plethora of things I want to explore and experience. Things I want to achieve and make a reality. Some are more feasible than others and this place is my attempt of getting a grip on them. Spelling them out, thinking them through and reflecting on steps I have taken will hopefully lead to a bit more control.

Again, my brain is getting ahead of my writing. Needing to slow down. Otherwise this will all turn into rambling. Not that I have a straight plan of what to write laid out. Quite the contrary. I don't know, what I am doing here.

Well, how did I get here? It was the day before yesterday, that I was leaving school and then went of on a trajectory, that brought me here. Of course it did, otherwise I would be somewhere else. What I am getting at is, that I feel highly unqualified for any of this. Why should I be allowed to write anything public? 

I did not finish university, did not get what we call here Ausbildung. I am in debt and will be for some time. Not even a noteable portfolio. Nada. Just a rented server and a work computer. A family and a piece of land. I managed to get people to give me a contract that says web developer, which translates to frontend developer. So, despite my aspirations to become a pop star when I was 9, I became just a guy. One person in this world. 

While I am at it, I acknowledge and am very aware of the fact, that I am still more privileged than most. I am a 40 year old, white, cis male with a EU passport. I never experienced discrimination, so I hope I manage to write in a way, that does not ever suggest I did.

Back to 9 year old me. I was in a band, later, but not very interested in rehearsing. Which turned out to be the core issue of my failed artist career. Rehearsing. Working on your thing. Sitting down to do the work. Show up especially when it is hard. No. again and again, I let myself be discouraged.

Then drugs. Perfect distraction. Coming from a tolerant, single mother household, there was a lot of parent free time. Free from parents, who came from the student revolution generation and where not prohibitive while being unintrusive. There was no pushing me to do something. Yeah, so I didn't. I mean, of course I did. Not being able to do nothing. But I wasn't productive. Dope, LSD, alcohol. 

Now, I just got off coffeine. Aiming to be clean. Going on 5 years sober. Hadn't smoked in almost 11 years. So that is something. 40 seems to be the age where you can see the effects of ones lifestyle in your old classmates.

My challenge now is, where do I start rehearsing. I am in the middle of live. Things have to mean something, right? When back then, playing around with things. Trying out something new was effortless, nowadays, there are commitments and responsibilities that keep you in that Ernst des Lebens if you let them. And that is okay. I love my wife and our family, that we are building and at the same time, I long to continue what I started back then.

Without the overhead of the drugs and the avoidance of emotions. While I do feel matured, I am lacking the practice and experience of those who started early and kept at it. I did other things, just as valid. And life is obviously more than this one thing. Publishing a record. Having a gallery opening. Writing a book. I am old enough now, to have the humbling experience to find the heros of my past be in the past. Forgotten and buried by time.

There is this quote from DJ Shadow in the Scratch documentary, where he stands in this basement full of records and talks about being humbled by all these people who contributed to these piles. So, is it really worth it to want to contribute one more? Or two? I guess the same goes for images and texts. after laying in bed awake and now being up at 3:24 a.m. to write these lines, my conclusion is yes. Yes it is worth it and I won't let myself stop me from pursuing this.

### Images

I already mentioned it here and there. I am interested in image creation. Drawing also. The big chunk of learning that is starring my down is the draw-a-box course, which I find highly intriguing. One thing to do with this space here is collect and archive my past achievements. There were some okay things in there.

### Design

This ties back in with the above. One thing i want to learn and do well is design things on paper or on screen. Maybe even projection. Me getting to work on this website is me working on my design game. Which is not good at the moment of writing this. But I have something in mind, I have taste and I know where I want this to go. So there is hope.

### Sound

Organized sound or music. Funky stuff and destructive noise. I just bought an acoustic bass and an e-piano. There is a music theory course waiting for me at Udemy. Let's go.

### Tech. Something with computers

I feel very sneaky. Going behind the gatekeepers. Making this mine. I am part of this world. I own a computer. I can make stuff. No need to ask for permission. I didn't study CS. So what. I know how to fact check something and I can articulate a sentence. It is mine now. Hah. (BTW this is the fundamental lesson for anyone learing a new language. Stop asking for permission. Make it your own.)

Work is pushing me to make the AWS Cloud Developer certificate. There is time to study for this and do some projects.

### Cooking and recipes

For the balance of things. Also to talk about project management. From Taco tuesday to pancake breakfast. Collecting things I learned and make me reflect on the way I cook. Because I cook a lot. So there is experience and routine there. But I could still use some deliberate practice to improve things.

### Fiction and games

Create a world and invite everybody in. Let's explore our minds and imagination.
