I find it hard to focus on one task in particular. Every day I wake up, there are a myriad of things I could do. Now that I manage to get up early and actually be productive on my own time, staying on track is hard.

Making lists does not solve this. It is like I completely forget about one thing I was working on the other day. "I want to work on my portfolio." "Let's learn AWS?" "How about some styling here?" "We could also practice piano?" "Make music." "Record" "That is some interesting drawing course there" "Pottery?"

It is ridiculous. Like this, I am getting nowhere. I'll keep pushing water. But how to change this? Get in control?

That is the question I am actually trying to answer since getting out of school and here I am, twenty years later.

What is it that I want? I want to be an artist working with code. That is what I want, deep inside. Be an artist. Like that Frederic. Ha. Now that I am typing it out, it comes down to this.

There is this inner voice. As cheesy as it sounds. Create colourful things. With no immediate use. Just shiny, pretty to look at. To get lost in. To wander and wonder. 

Pressfield was right. The length we're going to in order to avoid answering this inner calling. I created a whole mountain of distractions. My life is a simple avoidance move. Nothing less. And that is okay. I come to this conclusion with peace. It is what it is and now, human beings depend on me. That is not something to take lightly. Yes, one impulse is to just throw it all away to get to work, but that is not what I am going to do. On the contrary. King said it best: Art is a meant to support life, not the other way around.

So what now? Use the little fragment in the morning on my own things. Not work on something for work. No. These quiet moments are mine. And they are sacred. No one touches them. It is just me. So I have this done, before starting into my day.

Inventory time. 

The astro app is working. This will be my workbench for browser related stuff. All the code goes in there. For now. This way I am hoping to prevent myself from scattering between repos.

There is a number of things I would like to build in here. For one, a showcase area with things I achieved. On the other hand, numberous tools and things to create in the browser.
