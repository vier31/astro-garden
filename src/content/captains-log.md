# Captain's Log

Yeah, this garden has a captain. Of course, silly.

## What do I have in mind?

This project is supposed to serve as my digital home and portfolio. A place to bring all the bytes and pieces that I am producing or have produced together. Show off, learn and develop.

A digital garden is the perfect approach to escape the concept of a stream. I like streams, as a consumer. But not as a producer.

Here, I can have a bunch of files on my hard drive. I can pick one, or another. Start here, switch over to there. No need to hit publish, because it is already out in the open anyway. Easy.

## So what do I have so far?

This project is build with Astro and so far I like it that way. Let's try to keep JS to a minimum.

I host the repository on a Gitea instance and deploy via Jenkins. Al of this is done on Uberspace. This way, I found, it is clear and relatively simple, while being self-hosted and under my control. Except for the actual server, agreed, but we'll get to that eventually.
